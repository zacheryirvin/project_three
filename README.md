### The Problem
* A grocery tracking program is needed to categorize and keep track of the items that are purchased. The program should allow for searching of the items and sorting them by frequency.

### What did you do particulary well
* The use of classes to provide encapsulated code that make the code easier to read, organize, and maintain is an area that I did particulary well. I belive that my use of the set feature also helps in the implematation of a program with object oriented design.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make our code more efficient, secure, and so on?
* One area that could be enhanced is the input validation. The program currently only checks if the user input exists. Adding this could also allow for better search results and lead into better error handling.

### Which piece of code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
* Implementation of the histogram was the most challenging part of the program for myself. I worked thorugh this problem by compartmentalizing the problem and working through it one piece at a time. Writing short pieces of code and checking functionality worked well.
* I made extensive use of the c++ documentation for build in methods, their operation, and implementation into my program.

  ### What skills from this project will be particulary transferable to other projects or coursework?
* This particular project cemented by understanding of classes and how to implement them in a project effectivly. It also gave me practice for input and output operations as well as error handling.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* The use of classes and transferability of these classes between different aspects of the program help in both maintainability and adaptability. The use of clear and concise function names aids in the readability of the program.
